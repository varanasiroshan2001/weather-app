# Development of a fully fledged hardware to software weather station app integration with azure

Problem -- 
Due to the most of the incoming services on weather people are not able to see and take accurate measurements on custom area.. 

Solution using Azure -- 
So I have developed a hardware integration where we installed a weather station physically on my house and with attachment of all types of sensors like UV Sensor, Lux sensor, rain sensor, temperature, pressure, humidity, air pollution levels sensors and many more. I integrated all those hardware devices with one single unit with Arduino and with the help of IoT then wrote the website code with Javascript and CSS and using nodejs and react..I used Azure app services to load them with it and Azure DevOps for cont. monitoring and seeing them through CI/CD pipelines. Then also used Cosmo DB for all weather database storing in key pair format and generating report and doing it further on.
